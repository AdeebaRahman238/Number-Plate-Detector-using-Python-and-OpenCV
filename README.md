# Number Plate Detection using Python & OpenCV

This project detects and reads vehicle number plates from images using OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition.

---

## 📌 Features

- Detects number plates from car images
- Uses edge detection and contour approximation
- Extracts and reads text using Tesseract OCR
- Displays both the number plate and the original image with bounding box
